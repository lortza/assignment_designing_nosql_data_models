## Scenario

You're building an activity feed for a social media site. The feed must display a chronological list of activities for the current user's friends. These activities could potentially be any action performed on the site including uploading a photo, changing their profile, friending another user, commenting, liking etc... Further, you only want to display activities for users that the current user interacts with frequently.
